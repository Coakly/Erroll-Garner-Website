            <p>
                <b>Garner's General Style</b></br>
                He was influenced by Fats Waller's rhythmic stride piano playing and is often compared to Art Tatum (another pianist from the same era considered among the best jazz pianists of all time). 
                Both Tatum and Garner attacked the piano when playing, but Tatum's playing was swingier, while Garner's was funkier.</p>
                
                <b>Locked hands</b></br>
                Garner used a style of playing still common today called “locked hands,” where hands move up and down in the same general position. 
                It is a way to implement the "block chord" method of harmony on a keyboard instrument. 
                The locked hands technique requires the pianist to play the melody using both hands in unison. Erroll was a master of this technique and his style is still
                distinct even today.</p>

                <b>Garner's Stage Persona</b></br>
                Apart from his distinctive approach, he possessed a remarkable flair for showmanship.
                His iconic vocalization resonated through live performances and recordings, providing an entertaining spectacle. 
                His diminutive stature (standing at just 5'2") became a source of amusement during his stage acts and television appearances, often requesting phone books to elevate himself to piano-playing height. 
                This, coupled with his dapper attire and charismatic on-screen presence, set him apart from fellow jazz pianists.
                In fact, he is quoted as saying: 
                
                <p><b>"I always play what I feel. </br>I always feel like me, but I’m a different me every day. </br> I get ideas from everything.</br>  
                A big color, the sound of water and wind, or a flash of something cool.</br> Playing is like life.</br> Either you feel it or you don't."</b></p>
            </p>
